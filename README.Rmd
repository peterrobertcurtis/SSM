The SSM package provides functions to fit, plot and predict using smooth
supersaturated models.  It defines an S4 class called "SSM", and methods for
plotting and predicting them.  The fitting function is highly customizable and
provides optional sensitivity analysis and the provision to estimate metamodel
error using a Gaussian process.

---

The following code will fit a smooth supersaturated model to a 20 point design 
in four factors. Note the design should be held in a matrix, not a data.frame,
and all entries must be numeric.  The options `SA`, `GP` and `validation` turn
on automated sensitivity analysis, Gaussian process metamodel error estimation 
and Leave-One-Out cross-validation respectively.  The `plot` method plots the
main effects of the model while the `predict` method gives the model prediction
at a point and also a 95% credible interval if a metamodel error GP has been 
fit.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
X <- matrix(runif(80, -1, 1), ncol = 4)
Y <- apply(apply(X, 1, "^", 1:4), 2, sum)
s <- fit.ssm(X, Y, SA = TRUE, GP = TRUE, validation = TRUE)
s
plot(s, yrange="yrange")
predict(s, rep(0.5, 4))
sensitivity.plot(s)
```
